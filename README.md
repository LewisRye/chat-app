# Chat App by Lewis Rye
A Java chat app, allowing for multiple client connections to a central server. This project uses Sockets and gave me an understanding of networking in Java. Can be hosted locally or on a remote server. Still in development.

Because this project is still in development, these changes are being considered for the future:
- Improved GUI
- Easier instructions to setup on external server
- Friends list
- Bug fixes
